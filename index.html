<h1>Adjusting RAD</h1>
    <p>How to dial RAD (Rider Area Distance) for BMX.In BMX racing, the Rider Area Distance (RAD) plays a pivotal role in finding the ideal balance between control and power.
        It's the key to optimizing efficiency, enhancing gate start performance, and refining bike handling on the track.
         By concentrating on the measurement between the center of the bottom bracket and the centerline of the handlebar, RAD directly impacts your stance, power output, and maneuverability during racing.
          A bike with an optimally measured RAD allows for a more natural riding position, which in turn, enables the rider to exert maximum power and maintain control with less effort.</p>

        <h2>What is RAD</h2>
        <p>RAD is the distance from the bottom bracket to the centerline between the grips. When RAD is dialed in, the bike just feels right: more torque for gate starts, smoother control in corners and jumps. When RAD is too long, less torque and control. When it’s too short, rider posture is moved uncomfortably forward. Power transfer is good. If I’m unsure, I stay slightly on the short side.</p>

        <h3>How to Measure Frame RAD</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Run a string or tape from the top of one grip to the top of the other grip (about where my middle-finger knuckle sits). This gives you a centerline between the bar.</li>
          <li>Measure from the middle of the bottom bracket, parallel with the frame, to a that string. That number is the bike’s RAD.</li>
          <li>From experience, most bikes end up too long, a few are too short, and very few are perfect. I check mine any time I change bars, stems, or frames.</li>

            <strong>Prepare Your Stance</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>Stand next to a wall with your chest up and shoulders back.</li>

              <li>With a dry-erase marker in each fist, extend your arms and mark hand height on the wall.</li>
              <li>Measure from the floor to the mark—use centimeters for precision.</li>

        <h3>How to adjust RAD </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>If rider area feels too long, try a shorter stem (some riders go down to ~30&nbsp;mm). Bars with more backsweep/setback can also shorten effective reach and make the fit click.</li>
          <li>If rider area feels too short (rare), I try a longer stem.</li>
          <li>I make one change at a time, re-measure, and ride to feel the difference.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>RAD nuetral:</strong> The balance where the distance and angle between your bottom bracket and handlebars match your size, optimizing power and movement. .</p>
        <p><strong>RAD minus:</strong>A setup where the handlebars are closer to the bottom bracket than in the neutral position, great for manualing and jumping, it improves control for and tight maneuvers. </p>
        <p><strong>RAD plus:</strong>This increases the distance from the bottom bracket to the handlebars, stretching your position but decreasing your power output.  </p>
